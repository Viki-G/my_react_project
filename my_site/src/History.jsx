<h1>The history of 3D animation</h1>
<div id="his1">
    <h3>1960s–1970s: The Early Experiments</h3>
    <p>3D animation began as an experimental concept in the late 1960s. Early pioneers like 
    Ivan Sutherland, with his Sketchpad program, laid the groundwork for interactive 
    computer graphics. Around the same time, companies like NASA and research centers were 
    experimenting with wireframe models to visualize data and spacecraft.</p>
    <p>In 1972, a student film titled “A Computer Animated Hand” by Ed Catmull 
    ,who later co-founded Pixar, became one of the first fully 3D computer-generated animations.
     It showed a moving, rotating human hand and marked a turning point.

    <h3>1980s: The First Steps into Film</h3>
    <p>The 1980s were crucial for turning 3D animation into a storytelling tool.</p>
    <p>1982: Tron (Disney) was one of the first major films to combine live action with extensive 3D CGI.</p>
    <p>1984: The short film The Adventures of André and Wally B. by Lucasfilm’s Computer Division (later Pixar) showed fluid motion,
         squash and stretch, and character animation — a glimpse of Pixar’s future style.</p>
    <p>1986: Pixar was officially founded, and the same year it released Luxo Jr., a short film that won critical 
        acclaim and introduced the world to emotionally expressive 3D animation.</p>

<h3>1990s: The 3D Boom</h3>
<p>1991: Terminator 2: Judgment Day brought realistic CGI characters to the big screen.

1993: Jurassic Park used CGI dinosaurs with unprecedented realism, blending animatronics and 3D animation.

1995: Pixar’s Toy Story became the first fully 3D animated feature film — a landmark that changed animation forever.</p>

<div id="his4">
<h3>2000s: Refinement and Realism</h3>
<p>As software advanced (Maya, 3ds Max, Blender), 3D animation became more detailed, efficient, and accessible.

Films like Shrek (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), and The Incredibles (2004) pushed both storytelling and visual fidelity.

Studios started integrating motion capture (mo-cap) to bring realism to human movement — seen in The Polar Express 
(2004) and Avatar (2009), which blended performance capture with 3D environments in groundbreaking ways.</p>

<div id="his5">
<h3>2010s–Now: Real-Time, Indie, and Innovation</h3>
<p>Today, 3D animation is everywhere — from AAA games to indie films, virtual reality to YouTube shorts.

Real-time engines like Unreal Engine and Unity allow animators to render complex scenes instantly.

Open-source tools like Blender have democratized 3D animation, giving solo creators the same tools as big studios.

3D is now used in medicine, architecture, education, and the metaverse — far beyond film and TV.

<div id="his6">
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>With AI-assisted animation, virtual production (like in The Mandalorian), and immersive tech like AR/VR, the next chapter of 3D animation is being written right now — faster and more creatively than ever.</p>
